    /// Since the first version of VAST, the MediaFiles element was designated for linear video files. Over the
    /// years as digital video technology advanced, the media files placed in a VAST tag have come to include
    /// complex files that require API integration. Players not equipped with the technology to execute such files
    /// may be unable to play the ad or execute interactive components. In ads that require API integration, VAST 4
    /// separates media and interactive files. While `<MediaFiles>` node focus shifts to the exclusive delivery of
    /// media (video and audio), the dedicated `<InteractiveCreativeFile>` element opens opportunities for rendering
    /// modern secure interactive components in parallel with video and audio assets. The dedicated `<Verification>`
    /// element allows for measurement capabilities. Disjoining media and executable files enables a wider range of
    /// players to consume enhanced ads as well as performance improvements.
    ///
    /// It is worth noting that when multiple MediaFile nodes are present, the publisher should decide which file to
    /// play based on attributes of the MediaFile nodes and not the structure of the document (e.g. defaulting to
    /// the first MediaFile included in the document).

    ///     Format Guidelines for guidance on ready-to-serve file quality specifications.
    ///   - **Video/Audio file for use in ad-stitching:** In addition to the three ready-to-serve files, use the
    ///     `<Mezzanine>` element to include a URI to the raw video or audio file. Please review the IAB Digital
    ///     Video Ad Format Guidelines for guidance on mezzanine file specifications.
    ///   - **Interactive linear video file:** In addition to at least one ready-to-serve video/audio file included in
    ///     the `<MediaFile>` element, use the `<InteractiveCreativeFile>` element to include a URI to the
    ///     interactive media file, specifying the API framework required to execute the file.
